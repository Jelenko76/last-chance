# Yoga Studio Website
This is a simple website for a yoga studio that includes a photo gallery and a sign-up form.

## Styling

The code provided contains some basic styling for a website using CSS. The CSS is included within the HTML files themselves, rather than in an external stylesheet.

## HTML Files

There are three HTML files provided: `index.html`, `signup.html`, and `gallery.html`.

### index.html

`index.html` contains a navigation menu and a sign-up form for a yoga class.

### signup.html

`signup.html` is the page where users can sign up for the yoga class. It includes a form for entering a name, email, and selecting a class.

### gallery.html

`gallery.html` The gallery displays 14 images of various yoga poses. The images are stored in the assets/images directory, and are named yoga00.jpeg through yoga13.jpeg. The gallery is styled using CSS to display the images in a grid with a fixed width and height, and with a margin between each image.

## CSS Files

The CSS for the website is contained within the HTML files themselves, rather than in a separate stylesheet.

### style.css

`style.css` contains basic styling for the website. It includes styling for the form on the `signup.html` page, as well as some basic styling for the `gallery.html` page.





Sign-Up Form
The sign-up form allows users to sign up for yoga classes. The form includes input fields for name, email, password, and a select dropdown for class options. The form requires all fields to be filled out before submitting. 
When the user clicks the "Sign Up" button, the form is submitted to a form submission endpoint, which is currently set to "#" as a placeholder.

Running the Website
To run the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website should display the photo gallery and the sign-up form. The website is fully static and does not require any additional setup or configuration.

Future Improvements
Some possible improvements to the website include:

Adding more pages and information about the yoga studio
Adding a real form submission endpoint and connecting the sign-up form to a database
Adding more dynamic elements such as animations and interactive features
